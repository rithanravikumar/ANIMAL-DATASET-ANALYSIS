Welcome to my analysis of the ANIMAL DATASET. This project is focused on exploring and extracting insights from the dataset to answer key questions and uncover meaningful patterns.
Through this analysis, I aim to demonstrate how data-driven decision-making can provide valuable insights.

The dataset contains 205 rows and 16 columns, detailing various attributes of animals. Here's an overview of the columns:

Animal: Name of the animal.
Height (cm): Height range in centimeters.
Weight (kg): Weight range in kilograms.
Color: Primary color(s) of the animal.
Lifespan (years): Average lifespan range in years.
Diet: Type of diet (e.g., herbivore, carnivore).
Habitat: Typical living environments.
Predators: Common predators of the species.
Average Speed (km/h): Usual speed range in km/h.
Countries Found: Geographic distribution.
Conservation Status: Threat level (e.g., vulnerable, endangered).
Family: Taxonomic family.
Gestation Period (days): Pregnancy duration range.
Top Speed (km/h): Maximum speed in km/h.
Social Structure: Behavior pattern (e.g., solitary, group-based).
Offspring per Birth: Number of offspring per birthing event.
